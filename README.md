<h1>googleMapScrapper</h1>

Hi this is a basic web scrapper for google maps, what I have done here is that I have used selenium module to get the dynamic data from the browser and 
enter user defined data in the search box so that the user can search whatever he/ she wants to(PS search in the console of the IDE).


I have used the chrome web driver, you can use it as well, you can find its related version on <a>https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads</a>

Also I have used BueatifulSoup4 module to get the static data.

Finally i have used MongoDB to store the results.


I am also open for <b>constructive feedback</b> and <b>advices</b> to further improve this project.
